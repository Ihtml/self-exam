E-books or Paper Books的征文
- 你喜欢电子书还是纸质书？
- 理由是什么？
    It is convenient to get E-book as to get paper book for us. Here is coming a very hot topic : whether E-book can replace paper book or not.

    On one hand, there are some people considering that paper book will not be replaced forever. For one thing, although E-book are easier for carrying, we can not use them whenever we need, because they must be read through professional tools, such as mp3, mp4, and so on. What's more, plenty of knowledge has been recorder in paper book rather than E-book. To make things credibler, there are not enough E-book concluding professional knowledge for us to use on the net.

    On the other hand, some people hold the opinion that E-books will take the place of paper books. It is said that E-books do not use any paper unless we need them to be printed which do some kind of good to our environment. This can be an important why E-books are accepted by a great number of people. Moreover, E-books are easier for carrying and we  can get the book immediately through internet, evne if it is thousands miles away.

    For me, I can read a great deal of novels without buying them home. But that do not *delicate* E-books can replace paper books, at least in recents years. For paper book is more worthy of being collected than e-book.
